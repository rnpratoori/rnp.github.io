I am a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University, specializing in Engineering Mechanics and Advanced Scientific Computing. Previously, I obtained an M.Sc. (Hons.) in Chemistry along with a B.E. (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering and received my M.S. (by Research) in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. My research focuses on multiscale modeling of polymers and metals, ranging from molecular to continuum scales.
